## Release process
1. Make sure that the changelog is updated
2. Make sure that the version in pubspec.yaml is correct
3. Create a release in the github UI.
    - release name: Version number prefixed with "v", e.g. for version 3.4.7, name the release v3.4.7
    - tag name = release name
4. A pipeline will run and deploy the new version to pub.dev
