## Release process

    1. Make sure that the changelog is updated

    2. Make sure that the version in pubspec.yaml is correct

    3. Create a release in the github UI. Name the release like the version, but with a v (3.7.5 -> v3.7.5). Name the tag like the release

    4. A pipeline will run and deploy the new version to pub.dev
